# React-Dashboard Boilerplate
Dynamically generate a boilerplate project using the example project from current stable version of react-dash library

Use the project in /src as a starting place for your new dash project.

## Requirements
- nodejs
- webpack

## Instructions:
* clone this repository
* `cd react-dash-boilerplate`
* `npm install`
* `npm run dev_standalone`
* visit localhost:5000

## Development
See README documentation at https://github.com/NuCivic/react-dash
Once you have the starter project up and running you can delete the .git folder and create your own repository. 

## Build
To compile the project:

```
npm run build_standalone
```

This will output two different files: 

```
dist/build.min.css
dist/build.min.js
```
